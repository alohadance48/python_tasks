# Python Apps

Hi! I'm a beginning programmer and I make some useful apps.

The first app is based on one of the problems, and I've created this app helps to solve this task.
This task defines like this:
- It's been an array and you can spawn on `number1` number. Your standing represents your jump. You must go to the end! Standing on `0` means you've lost.

Good luck!
